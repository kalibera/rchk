# Automated installation (Docker/Virtualbox)

One can use a pre-installed virtual machine with rchk (or, more precisely,
use an automated script that installs such machine without user
intervention, into virtualbox or docker).  Please note that this is
conceptually the same thing as downloading the binary image from docker
hub/virtualbox repository, it is just independent on such repositories and
takes slightly longer (within 15 minutes on my laptop) to automatically
install. The installation will create a virtual machine into which one can
log in and perform the checks, all state is kept inside the machine.

Run `vagrant up` in `image` directory to use VirtualBox or `vagrant up
--provider docker` to use Docker.

One needs to install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (`apt-get install
vagrant`) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
(`apt-get install virtualbox`) or
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (`apt-get install docker
docker.io`, add current user to the `docker` group).

If `vagrant up` fails or times out due to network connectivity issues,
`vagrant provision` restarts it.  To log into the installed machined, use
`vagrant ssh` and check the first R package using instructions provided
[here](../README.md).  One can access the host file system in directory
`/vagrant` inside the virtual installation, e.g.  to copy package tarballs
in and out.

# Automated installation (Singularity)

On Linux, one can install also into a singularity container
([instructions](SINGULARITY.md) and configuration contributed by B. 
W.  Lewis, with some maintenance/updates from me).  This setup is aimed
directly at checking of packages, one normally would not log into the
virtual machine, but the machine keeps some state on the host system
(package library, temporary build files, and rchk reports).  For just
checking of packages on Linux, this is easier to use than the Docker/Virtualbox
one. Even the text may seem long, the installation can be as simple as
(running on Ubuntu 18.04 as host system):

```
apt-get install singularity-container debootstrap
singularity build rchk.img singularity.def
```

and the checking just (package memisc from CRAN).

```
/usr/bin/singularity run rchk.img memisc
```

and the results appear under subdirectory "lib" of the current directory. 
Full path to the package tarball can be given instead as argument to check a
testing version of the package.

# Alternative automated installations

An alternative docker image is also available from third parties on R-hub
(`rhub/ubuntu-rchk`,
[source](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders/tree/master/ubuntu-rchk)).

# Native installation on Linux

Once the installation is finished, check the first R package using
instructions provided [here](../README.md). Note that rchk currently does
not work with LLVM 8 and newer due to a change in the LLVM API.

## Fedora 29 and 30

These instructions are for LLVM 7. Tested March 6, 2019 on a clean install

It seems these messages can be ignored.

# Installing on older systems

While rchk used to work on older systems, it is not being backported to them
and cannot be compiled with older versions of LLVM due to incompatibility of
the API.  One can get an old version of rchk to work with LLVM 3.6
(`llvm-36` branch) and with LLVM 3.8 (`llvm-38` branch), but these older
versions of rchk do not include the latest fixes to work well with the
latest (development) version of R, and hence they are not recommended for
use.  It should, however, be possible to install rchk on an older system
with a working installation of LLVM 4, 5 or 6.  I've been using rchk on many
earlier versions of Ubuntu, so Ubuntu and Debian are likely to be easiest to
use.  Also I've used rchk regularly on several versions of Fedora. 
Particularly on older systems or with older versions of rchk, it is
recommended to use GCC/g++ instead of LLVM/clang++ to compile rchk as
crashes have been observed when compiled with clang++.  Earlier version of
rchk had an access-out-of-bounds bug that incidentally has been causing
crashes on Gentoo but not other systems.
